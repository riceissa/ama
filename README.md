# Ask me anything

## History

I had been [thinking](https://github.com/riceissa/project-ideas/issues/34)
for some time about how to make it easier for people to ask me questions.
After I set up my [Tumblr AMA](https://riceissa.tumblr.com/ask),
I realized that I could do something similar on GitHub.
I then [googled](https://www.google.com/search?q=github+ask+me+anything) and found that
others had indeed come up with the same idea.
